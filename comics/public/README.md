# comics
A website designed to show the upcoming comic releases, as well as creating a database of comics that have been released over time. On top of keeping track of upcoming comics, the site has holds allows for users to create a catalog of their own collections.

The original goal was to create a site where people could also talk about and compare the comics they have read, and even allow for the trading or selling of comics back and forth, but the scope was too large for the time I gave myself.
